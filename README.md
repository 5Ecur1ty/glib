### Go bindings for GLib type system.

This package is designed for building bindings to C libraries based on GLib type
system (like GTK, GStreamer, and others).

See example [GTK](https://github.com/ziutek/gtk) bindings or
[GStreamer](https://github.com/ziutek/gst) bindings for example code.

See [glib_test.go](https://github.com/ziutek/glib/blob/master/glib_test.go) for
signal/event handling model.
